Deep learning (DL) has emerged as a promising tool in healthcare
applications. However, the reproducibility of many studies in this
field is limited by the lack of accessible code implementations and
standard benchmarks. To address the issue, we create PyHealth, a
comprehensive library to build, deploy, and validate DL pipelines for
healthcare applications. PyHealth supports various data modalities,
including electronic health records (EHRs), physiological signals,
medical images, and clinical text. It offers various advanced DL
models and maintains comprehensive medical knowledge systems.
The library is designed to support both DL researchers and clinical
data scientists. Upon the time of writing, PyHealth has received
700+ stars, 150+ forks, and 15k+ downloads in total on GitHub.

In today's digital era, efficiently extracting structured knowledge from raw text is more crucial than ever. TxBKG rises to this challenge, leveraging the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLM) to derive Knowledge Graphs (KG) from unstructured content. One of TxBKG's standout features is its adaptability: users can craft their own prompts, directing the LLM to extract KGs tailored to their unique needs. Beyond extraction, the platform's intuitive interface empowers users to modify the resulting KGs, ensuring the data aligns perfectly with their objectives. An added advantage is TxBKG's support for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) from PDF files, transforming static documents into dynamic, structured knowledge. Furthermore, TxBKG prioritizes user convenience; individuals can save their customized grouped prompts, texts, and extracted KGs using their Google account, ensuring their tailored configurations and data are always within reach. Dive deep into the realm of structured data extraction with TxBKG.
