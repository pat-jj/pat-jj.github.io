Greetings! This is Patrick (Pengcheng), currently a graduate student in the Computer Science Department at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). I have had the distinct honor of being under the mentorship of Prof. <a href='https://www.sunlab.org/'>Jimeng Sun</a>, whose guidance has been invaluable to my research in the intersection of AI & Healthcare. I am also glad to have been working with Prof. <a href='http://hanj.cs.illinois.edu/'>Jiawei Han</a> for text mining related research, with a special focus on pre-trained language models and knowledge graphs. Prior to my journey at UIUC, I earned my B.E. in Computer Science and Engineering from Waseda University in Tokyo, Japan, where my research was co-supervised by Profs. <a href='https://www.tei-lab.jp/en/professors/'>Kenji Tei</a> and <a href='https://www.nii.ac.jp/en/faculty/architecture/honiden_shinichi/'>Shinichi Honiden</a>. After Waseda and before UIUC, I spent one year at Ant Group as a full-time AI Engineer.

My current research interests orbit around:

 * Machine Learning for Healthcare & Drug Discovery

 * Knowledge Graphs and Graph Neural Networks 

 * Data Mining (especially Text Mining)

 * Reasoning in Large Language Models
