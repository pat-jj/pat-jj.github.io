Hello and welcome! I'm Patrick (Pengcheng), currently a graduate student in the Computer Science Department at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). 

I am privileged to be mentored by [Prof. Jimeng Sun](https://www.sunlab.org/), whose insights have been pivotal in shaping my research at the intersection of AI and Healthcare. I am also glad to be advised by [Prof. Jiawei Han](http://hanj.cs.illinois.edu/) for text mining related research, with a special focus on pre-trained language models and knowledge graphs.

#### Academic Journey

Prior to my studies at UIUC, I earned my B.E. in Computer Science and Engineering from Waseda University in Tokyo, Japan. In this chapter of my academic journey, I was fortunate to be co-supervised by [Prof. Kenji Tei](https://www.tei-lab.jp/en/professors/) and [Prof. Shinichi Honiden](https://www.nii.ac.jp/en/faculty/architecture/honiden_shinichi/). After Waseda and before UIUC, I dedicated a year in industry.

#### Research Interests

I have a wide array of research interests that span across various domains of NLP and AI4Science.

My past research mainly focused on:

- **Actionable Knowledge Extraction:** 
  - Prompt mining
  - Text summarization
  - Evaluation
  
  
- **Knowledge-Enhanced AI4Science:** 
  - Enhancing clinical predictions with KGs
  - Enhancing molecule representations with KGs


Recently, I've been working on **generative prompt mining** with LLMs.
