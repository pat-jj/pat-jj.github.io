Hello and welcome! I'm Patrick (Pengcheng), currently a graduate student in the Computer Science Department at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). 

I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Jimeng Sun](https://www.sunlab.org/), whose insights have been pivotal in shaping my research at the intersection of AI and Healthcare. 

I am also privileged to be advised by [Prof. Jiawei Han](http://hanj.cs.illinois.edu/) for text mining related research, with a special focus on pre-trained language model and knowledge graph (KG).

Prior to my studies at UIUC, I earned my B.E. in Computer Science and Engineering from Waseda University in Tokyo, Japan. In this chapter of my academic journey, I was fortunate to be co-advised by [Prof. Kenji Tei](https://www.tei-lab.jp/en/professors/) and [Prof. Shinichi Honiden](https://www.nii.ac.jp/en/faculty/architecture/honiden_shinichi/), focusing on formal methods. After Waseda and before UIUC, I dedicated a year in industry.

I have a wide array of research interests that span across various domains.

My recent research is mainly about:

- **Knowledge Extraction:** 
  - How to extract knowledge from unstructured data more efficiently and effectively?
  - How to evaluate the quality of extracted knowledge?
  
- **Knowledge-Enhanced AI4Health:** 
  - Using KGs to improve clinical predictions.
  - Using KGs to enhance molecule representation.

I am open to discussions on any promising research topics. Feel free to reach out: pj20[at]illinois[dot]edu
