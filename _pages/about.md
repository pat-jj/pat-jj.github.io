Hello and welcome! I'm Patrick (Pengcheng), currently a graduate student in the Computer Science Department at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). 

I am privileged to be mentored by [Prof. Jimeng Sun](https://www.sunlab.org/), whose insights have been pivotal in shaping my research at the intersection of AI and Healthcare. I am also glad to have been working with [Prof. Jiawei Han](http://hanj.cs.illinois.edu/) for text mining related research, with a special focus on pre-trained language models and knowledge graphs.

#### Academic Journey

Prior to my studies at UIUC, I earned my B.E. in Computer Science and Engineering from Waseda University in Tokyo, Japan. In this chapter of my academic journey, I was fortunate to be co-supervised by [Prof. Kenji Tei](https://www.tei-lab.jp/en/professors/) and [Prof. Shinichi Honiden](https://www.nii.ac.jp/en/faculty/architecture/honiden_shinichi/). After Waseda and before UIUC, I dedicated a year to sharpen my practical skills as a full-time AI Engineer at Ant Group.

#### Research Interests

My current research is centered around two main pillars:

- **Structured Knowledge Discovery through Text Mining:** 
  - Condensing knowledge through summarization
  - Probing knowledge from language models
  
- **Application of Structured Knowledge to Science Domain:** 
  - Enhancing healthcare prediction models
  - Accelerating the drug discovery process
