      title={GraphCare: Enhancing Healthcare Predictions with Personalized Knowledge Graphs}, 
      abstract={Clinical predictive models often rely on patients' electronic health records (EHR),
                but integrating medical knowledge to enhance predictions and decision-making is
                challenging. This is because personalized predictions require personalized knowledge
                graphs (KGs), which are difficult to generate from patient EHR data. To
                address this, we propose GRAPHCARE, an open-world framework that uses external
                KGs to improve EHR-based predictions. Our method extracts knowledge
                from large language models (LLMs) and external biomedical KGs to build patientspecific
                KGs, which are then used to train our proposed Bi-attention AugmenTed
                (BAT) graph neural network (GNN) for healthcare predictions. On two public
                datasets, MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV, GRAPHCARE surpasses baselines in four vital
                healthcare prediction tasks: mortality, readmission, length of stay (LOS), and
                drug recommendation. On MIMIC-III, it boosts AUROC by 17.6% and 6.6% for
                mortality and readmission, and F1-score by 7.9% and 10.8% for LOS and drug
                recommendation, respectively. Notably, GRAPHCARE demonstrates a substantial
                edge in scenarios with limited data availability. Our findings highlight the potential
                of using external KGs in healthcare prediction tasks and demonstrate the
                promise of GRAPHCARE in generating personalized KGs for promoting personalized
                medicine.},

      title={Bi-level Contrastive Learning for Knowledge-Enhanced Molecule Representations}, 
      abstract={Molecule representation learning underpins diverse downstream applications such as molecular property and side effect understanding and prediction. In this paper, we recognize the two-level structure of individual molecule as having intrinsic graph structure as well as being a node in a large molecule knowledge graph, and present GODE, a new approach that seamlessly integrates graph representations of individual molecules with multi-domain biomedical data from knowledge graphs. By pre-training two graph neural networks (GNNs) on different graph structures, combined with contrastive learning, GODE adeptly fuses molecular structures with their corresponding knowledge graph substructures. This fusion results in a more robust and informative representation, enhancing molecular property prediction by harnessing both chemical and biological information. Finetuned on 11 chemical property tasks, our model surpasses benchmarks, achieving an average ROC-AUC improvement of 14.5%, 9.8%, and 7.3% on BBBP, SIDER, and Tox21 datasets. In regression tasks on ESOL and QM7 datasets, we achieve average improvements of 21.0% and 29.6% improvements in RMSE and MAE, setting a new field benchmark.},

      title={TriSum: Learning Summarization Ability from Large Language Models}, 
      abstract={The advent of large language models (LLMs) greatly
        advanced natural language processing tasks, such as
        text summarization. However, due to their substantial
        model size, computational demands, and potential pri-
        vacy concerns when transmitting sensitive data for re-
        mote processing, their utility can be limited in resource-
        constrained environments and applications prioritizing
        data privacy. To address this, we introduce a frame-
        work called TriSum to distill the text summarization
        capabilities of LLMs into a more compact local model.
        In the first step, we employ LLMs to probe and ex-
        tract a collection of aspect-triple rationales and sum-
        maries. We then refine them by employing a dual-
        scoring method to identify the most high-quality ratio-
        nales. Moving to the second step, we train a smaller lo-
        cal model using these carefully organized summariza-
        tion tasks. Our training strategy employs a curriculum
        learning approach, gradually progressing from individ-
        ual tasks to more complex combinations. Our evalua-
        tions demonstrate that our TriSum method empowers
        the local model to outperform baselines by 4.5%, 8.5%,
        and 7.4% for the abstractive summarization task on CN-
        N/DailyMail, XSum, and ClinicalTrial respectively. Be-
        yond improved performance, our approach also offers
        insights into the rationale guiding the summarization
        process, thus enhancing interpretability.},

      title={GENRES: Rethinking Evaluation for Generative Relation Extraction in the Era of Large Language Models}, 
      abstract={The field of relation extraction (RE) is experiencing a notable shift towards generative relation extraction (GRE), leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, we discovered that traditional relation extraction (RE) metrics like precision and recall fall short in evaluating GRE methods. This shortfall arises because these metrics rely on exact matching with human-annotated reference relations, while GRE methods often produce diverse and semantically accurate relations that differ from the references. To fill this gap, we introduce \textsc{GenRES} for a multi-dimensional assessment in terms of the topic similarity, uniqueness, granularity, factualness, and completeness of the GRE results. With \textsc{GenRES}, we empirically identified that (1) precision/recall fails to justify the performance of GRE methods; (2) human-annotated referential relations can be incomplete; (3) prompting LLMs with a fixed set of relations or entities can cause hallucinations. Next, we conducted a human evaluation of GRE methods that shows \textsc{GenRES} is consistent with human preferences for RE quality. Last, we made a comprehensive evaluation of fourteen leading LLMs using \textsc{GenRES} across document, bag, and sentence level RE datasets, respectively, to set the benchmark for future research in GRE. },

To this end, we propose TagReal that automatically generates quality query prompts and retrieves support information from large text corpora to probe knowledge from PLM for KG completion. The results show that TagReal achieves state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets. We find that TagReal has superb performance even with limited training data, outperforming existing embedding-based, graph-based, and PLM-based methods.",

  abstract="One of the most prevalent diseases, skin cancer, has been proven to be treatable at an early stage. Thus, techniques that allow individuals to identify skin cancer symptoms early are in great demand. This paper proposed an interactive skin lesion diagnosis system based on the ensemble of multiple sophisticated CNN models for image classification. The performance of ResNet50, ResNeXt50, ResNeXt101, EfficientNetB4, Mobile-NetV2, MobileNetV3, and MnasNet are investigated separately as ensemble components. Then, using various criteria, we constructed ensembles and compared the accuracy they achieved. Moreover, we designed a method to update the ensemble for new data and examined its performance. In addition, a few natural language processing (NLP) techniques were used to make our system more user-friendly. To integrate all the functionalities, we built a user interface with PyQt5. As a result, MobileNetV3 achieved 91.02% as the best accuracy among all single models; ensemble weighted by cubic precision achieved 92.84% accuracy as the highest one in this study; a notable improvement in accuracy demonstrated the effectiveness of the model updating approach, and a system with all of the desired features was successfully developed. These findings benefit in two aspects. For model performance, applying cubic precisions can increase ensemble learning classification accuracy. For the developed diagnosis system, it can aid in the early detection of the skin lesions for skin cancer treatment.",

  abstract="Users interacting with a system through UI are
      typically obliged to perform their actions in a pre-determined
      order, to successfully achieve certain functional goals. However,
      such obligations are often not followed strictly by users, which
      may lead to the violation to security properties, especially in
      security-critical systems. To improve the security with the
      awareness of unexpected user behaviors, a system can be
      redesigned to a more robust one by changing the order of actions
      in its specification. Meanwhile, we anticipate that the functionalities would remain consistent following the modifications. In
      this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm to automatically
      produce specification revisions tackling the attack scenarios
      caused by weakened user obligations. By our algorithm, all the
      revisions would be generated to maintain the integrity of the
      functionalities using a novel recomposition approach. Then, the
      eligible revisions that can satisfy the security requirements
      would be efficiently spotted by a hybrid approach combining
      model checking and machine learning techniques. We evaluate
      our algorithm by comparing its performance with a state-of-the-art approach regarding their coverage and searching speed of
