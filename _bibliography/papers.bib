  abstract = {Deep learning (DL) has emerged as a promising tool in healthcare applications. However, the reproducibility of many studies in this field is limited by the lack of accessible code implementations and standard benchmarks. To address the issue, we create PyHealth, a comprehensive library to build, deploy, and validate DL pipelines for healthcare applications. PyHealth supports various data modalities, including electronic health records (EHRs), physiological signals, medical images, and clinical text. It offers various advanced DL models and maintains comprehensive medical knowledge systems. The library is designed to support both DL researchers and clinical data scientists. Upon the time of writing, PyHealth has received 633 stars, 130 forks, and 15k+ downloads in total on GitHub.This tutorial will provide an overview of PyHealth, present different modules, and showcase their functionality through hands-on demos. Participants can follow along and gain hands-on experience on the Google Colab platform during the session.},

    abstract = "The mission of open knowledge graph (KG) completion is to draw new findings from known facts. Existing works that augment KG completion require either (1) factual triples to enlarge the graph reasoning space or (2) manually designed prompts to extract knowledge from a pre-trained language model (PLM), exhibiting limited performance and requiring expensive efforts from experts. To this end, we propose TagReal that automatically generates quality query prompts and retrieves support information from large text corpora to probe knowledge from PLM for KG completion. The results show that TagReal achieves state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets. We find that TagReal has superb performance even with limited training data, outperforming existing embedding-based, graph-based, and PLM-based methods.",
